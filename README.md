#  Video Games Data Analysis Project - Avalugg

## About The Project

In this project, my goal is to make a proper analysis of video game industry between 2014-2020. 
I reproduced the raw data and made some readable and understandable graphs. 
With the help of the dataset, I found answers to certain questions. I hope you find something useful in the project.
